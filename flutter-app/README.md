# PlanGenie Flutter App

This directory contains the Flutter boilerplate for the PlanGenie mobile app. It is intentionally lean so you can iterate quickly during the hackathon and expand it as the product hardens.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Flutter 3.16+ installed and configured (`flutter doctor`).
2. From this folder, fetch packages:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the app on an emulator or device:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Project Layout
- `lib/src/app.dart` – Top-level widget that wires up theming and navigation.
- `lib/src/features/auth/login_screen.dart` – Production-ready auth entry point with email, phone, and Google flows.
- `lib/src/features/auth/signup_screen.dart` – Dedicated sign-up experience collecting profile details before account creation.
- `lib/src/features/home/home_screen.dart` – Post-login experience stub you can extend.
- `lib/firebase_options.dart` – Generated by FlutterFire CLI; contains platform-specific Firebase configuration.
- `lib/src/widgets/async_value_widget.dart` – Helper for rendering async state.
- `test/widget_test.dart` – Example widget test to keep the harness wired up.
- `assets/` – Place images, fonts, and other bundled resources here.

## Firebase Setup
The login experience relies on Firebase Authentication. Configure it before running the app:
1. Install the FlutterFire CLI: `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`.
2. Run `flutterfire configure --project plan-genie-hackathon` from this folder.
   - This regenerates `lib/firebase_options.dart` with real keys (the committed file only contains placeholders).
   - It also downloads platform config files when available.
3. Copy the generated secrets into the platform folders (these files are gitignored):
   - `android/app/google-services.json`
   - `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
4. Enable the following providers in the Firebase console under **Authentication → Sign-in method**:
   - Google
   - Email/Password
   - Phone

Update the OAuth redirect URIs on web/Android/iOS as instructed by Firebase when you enable Google sign-in.

### Platform bootstrap

After you generate the configs, run the platform-specific bootstrap commands once:

```bash
# iOS
cd ios
LANG=en_US.UTF-8 pod install --repo-update

# Android (back at flutter-app/)
flutter pub get
```

You can now run the app with `flutter run -d ios` or `flutter run -d android`.

## Next Steps
- Draft real features inside `lib/src/features/` grouped by domain.
- Add Riverpod or another state management package as needs evolve.
- Use `flutter create .` if you need additional platform scaffolding (macOS, web, etc.).
