# PlanGenie

PlanGenie is an AI-assisted travel planning experience created for the hackathon. The repository collects the visual assets, interactive mockups, the production FastAPI backend, and the Flutter client.

## Repository Structure
- `assets/` – High-fidelity visuals and diagrams used for pitches and documentation.
- `backend/` – FastAPI service that drafts itineraries via Vertex AI, enriches with Maps, and stores results in Firestore.
- `flutter-app/` – Flutter client that handles auth and connects to the backend.
- `infra.sh` – Helper script for container builds and Cloud Run deployment.
- `mockup/` – Vite + React click-through mockup of the core planning flow.
- `mockup-next/` – Next.js prototype exploring the production-ready app structure.

## Visual Assets
The `assets/` folder contains the following resources:
- `AI Trip Planner Mockup (AI).png` – Landing screen showcasing AI-powered destination discovery.
- `AI Trip Planner Mockup (Cart).png` – Booking cart concept with pricing and upgrade options.
- `AI Trip Planner Mockup (Itinerary).png` – Day-by-day itinerary view generated by the assistant.
- `Basic_FlowChart.png` – High-level user journey illustrating decision points.
- `Core-Booking-Flow.png` – Detailed flow of the reservation funnel from search to checkout.
- `System_Architecture(High-Level).png` – Architecture diagram outlining data sources and AI components.

Use these visuals in presentations, README badges, or within product documentation to communicate the experience quickly.

## Local Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm 9+ (bundled with Node 18)

Verify the versions with:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Running the Interactive Mockups
### Vite mockup
1. Install dependencies: `cd mockup && npm install`
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open the printed local URL (default `http://localhost:5173/`).

### Next.js prototype
1. Install dependencies: `cd mockup-next && npm install`
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Visit the printed URL (default `http://localhost:3000/`).

Both projects are self-contained. The commands above start local development servers with hot reload, letting you iterate on layout and flows in real time. Use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the server when finished.

## Contributing
1. Update or add new assets under `assets/` with clear naming.
2. Capture any major UX or architecture changes within the README to keep documents in sync.
3. Use feature branches and open pull requests for review.
